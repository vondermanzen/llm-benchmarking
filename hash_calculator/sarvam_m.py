4. Convert the result to Base64. Wait, the SHA-256 hash is a binary digest. So, after hashing, I need to take the digest bytes and then base64 encode them. So, for example, after step 3, I have a bytes object, then base64.b64encode() that. But the output of base64 might have padding, like '=' at the end. But the next step is RIPEMD-160 hash. So I need to pass the base64 bytes to that hash function.

Wait, the steps are:

3. Compute SHA-256 hash. Let's call this result1.

4. Convert result1 to Base64. So take the binary digest of the SHA-256 hash, then base64 encode it. So, for example, using base64.b64encode(result1.digest()). But wait, the SHA-256 digest is 32 bytes. Base64 encoding of 32 bytes would be (32 * 4/3) = ~43 characters (since each 3 bytes become 4 base64). But the next step is to compute RIPEMD-160 on that base64 data. So the input to RIPEMD-160 is the base64 encoded bytes of the SHA-256 hash.

5. Calculate RIPEMD-160 hash using hashlib.new('ripemd160'). So create a hash object with that name, update with the base64 data from step 4, then get the digest.

6. Convert to uppercase hex string. So after getting the RIPEMD-160 digest (which is bytes), convert it to a hex string, then uppercase. But the note says all hex strings should be lowercase except for this step. Wait, the note says "All hex strings should be lowercase" but step 6 says to convert to uppercase. So step 6's output is uppercase, but other steps must be lowercase. So after step 5, the RIPEMD-160 digest is bytes, then we do .hexdigest().upper().

7. Calculate SHA-1 hash. Take the uppercase hex string from step 6, convert that to bytes (using ASCII?), then compute SHA-1. Wait, but how? Because the SHA-1 hash function takes bytes as input. So the hex string (uppercase) needs to be converted to bytes. For example, if the hex string is 'A1B2C3', then the bytes would be b'A1B2C3'. So in Python, we can use the hex digest to bytes as .encode('ascii').

So step 7: take the uppercase hex string from step 6, encode to bytes, then compute SHA-1 on that.

8. Convert to lowercase hex string. So the SHA-1 digest is bytes, then .hexdigest().lower().

9. Calculate SHA-512 hash. Take the lowercase hex string from step 8, encode to bytes, then compute SHA-512.

10. Take first 32 bytes. So the SHA-512 digest is 64 bytes, take the first 32 bytes.

11. Calculate MD5 hash. Take the first 32 bytes from step 10, compute MD5.

12. Finally, calculate SHA-384 hash. Take the MD5 digest (16 bytes) from step 11, compute SHA-384, then take its hex digest (as bytes, then hexdigest).

The output is the hex string of step 12's SHA-384 hash.

Now, let's structure each step in code.

First, read the input string S.

Then:

Step 1: S is given.

Step 2: s_utf8 = S.encode('utf-8').

Step 3: sha256_hash = hashlib.sha256(s_utf8).digest() â†’ bytes.

Step 4: base64_bytes = base64.b64encode(sha256_hash). Then, the output of base64.b64encode is bytes, which we need to pass to RIPEMD-160.

So ripemd_input = base64_bytes.

Step 5: ripemd = hashlib.new('ripemd160').update(ripemd_input).digest().

Step 6: hex_upper = ripemd.hexdigest().upper().

Step 7: sha1_input = hex_upper.encode('ascii').

sha1_hash = hashlib.sha1(sha1_input).digest().

Step 8: lower_hex = sha1_hash.hexdigest().lower().

Step 9: sha512_input = lower_hex.encode('ascii').

sha512_hash = hashlib.sha512(sha512_input).digest().

Step 10: first_32 = sha512_hash[:32].

Step 11: md5_hash = hashlib.md5(first_32).digest().

Step 12: sha384_hash = hashlib.sha384(md5_hash).digest().hex().

Then, output sha384_hash.hexdigest().

Wait, but in Python, the hexdigest() returns a string. So the final output is that string.

Now, putting all this into code.

But need to handle all the steps correctly.

Let me code each step step by step.

First, import necessary modules:

import hashlib
import base64

Read input:

S = input().strip()

Then:

s_utf8 = S.encode('utf-8')

sha256_digest = hashlib.sha256(s_utf8).digest()

base64_bytes = base64.b64encode(sha256_digest)

ripemd_input = base64_bytes

ripemd = hashlib.new('ripemd160').update(ripemd_input).digest()
ripemd = hashlib.new('ripemd160')
ripemd.update(ripemd_input)
ripemd_digest = ripemd.digest()

hex_upper = ripemd_digest.hexdigest().upper()

sha1_input = hex_upper.encode('ascii')

sha1_hash = hashlib.sha1(sha1_input).digest()

lower_hex = sha1_hash.hexdigest().lower()

sha512_input = lower_hex.encode('ascii')

sha512_hash = hashlib.sha512(sha512_input).digest()

first_32 = sha512_hash[:32]

md5_hash = hashlib.md5(first_32).digest()

sha384_hash = hashlib.sha384(md5_hash).digest()

final_result = sha384_hash.hex()

print(final_result)

Wait, but the example output is 64 characters. Let's check:

SHA-384 produces a 384-bit (48-byte) hash. The hex string is 96 characters (48 * 2). But the example output is 64 characters. Wait, that's a problem.

Wait, the example input's output is 64 characters. But according to the steps, the final step is SHA-384 hash of the MD5 hash (16 bytes). So:

MD5 hash is 16 bytes. Then SHA-384 of that 16 bytes produces a 48-byte hash. The hex string would be 96 characters. But the example output is 64 characters. So this suggests that perhaps there's a mistake in the steps.

Wait, the problem statement's example output is 64 characters. Let's look back.

The example output is:

a9842d666c6d9a334d8987a0628c68d5302e9251c7e9f0168f7b5dd2b7ff2763c9ae92b6e4c574e4ba05c3108468db17

Which is 64 characters. So the final output is 64 characters. But according to the steps, the SHA-384 hash is computed on the MD5 hash (16 bytes), which would produce a 48-byte hash, leading to 96 hex characters.

This is a contradiction
