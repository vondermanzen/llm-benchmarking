Problem: Matrix Rank over GF(2)

Your task is to write a program that computes the rank of a matrix over GF(2) (binary field). The matrix will be given in the form of linear equations where all operations are performed modulo 2.

Input Format:
- The first line contains two integers N and M, where:
  * N is the number of equations (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000)
  * M is the number of variables (1 ≤ M ≤ 1000)
- The following N lines each contain M+1 binary digits (0 or 1):
  * The first M digits represent the coefficients of the variables
  * The last digit represents the constant term
- Each equation is of the form: a₁x₁ + a₂x₂ + ... + aₘxₘ = b (mod 2)
  where aᵢ and b are binary digits (0 or 1)

Output Format:
- A single integer representing the rank of the augmented matrix [A|b]

Example Input:
3 3
1 0 1 1
0 1 1 0
1 1 0 1

Example Output:
3

Explanation:
The system represents these equations mod 2:
x₁ + x₃ = 1
x₂ + x₃ = 0
x₁ + x₂ = 1

After converting to reduced row echelon form (mod 2):
1 0 0 1
0 1 0 0
0 0 1 0

The rank is 3 as there are 3 non-zero rows in the reduced form.

Note:
- All operations are performed modulo 2 (in GF(2))
- The rank is the number of non-zero rows in the reduced row echelon form
- A system may be inconsistent (no solution) or have multiple solutions
