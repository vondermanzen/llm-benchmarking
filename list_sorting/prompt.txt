Write a Python script that sorts a list of integers in ascending order. The script should read a list of integers from standard input and print the sorted list to standard output.

Input Format:
A single line containing space-separated integers.
Example:
3 1 4 1 5 9

Output Format:
A single line containing the sorted integers, space-separated.
Example:
1 1 3 4 5 9

Requirements:
The script should be self-contained.

It should include necessary imports (if any).

It should not require any user-defined functions unless needed for clarity or reuse.

Do not use any third-party libraries â€” only standard Python.

If this code editor has the ability to create files, please create a Python file containing this script.
