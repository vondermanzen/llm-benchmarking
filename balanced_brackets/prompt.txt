Problem: Balanced Brackets

Your task is to write a program that determines whether a sequence of brackets is properly balanced.

Input Format:
- The first line contains a single integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10,000), the length of the bracket sequence
- The second line contains a string of N characters, consisting only of brackets: '(', ')', '[', ']', '{', '}'

Output Format:
- A single line containing either "YES" if the brackets are balanced, or "NO" if they are not

A sequence of brackets is considered balanced if:
1. Every opening bracket has a matching closing bracket of the same type
2. The pairs of brackets are properly nested (inner pairs must be closed before outer pairs)

Example Input 1:
6
{[()]}

Example Output 1:
YES

Example Input 2:
4
{[}]

Example Output 2:
NO

Example Input 3:
2
)(

Example Output 3:
NO

Explanation:
- First example is balanced because:
  * Each bracket has a matching pair
  * Inner pairs () are closed before [], which are closed before {}
- Second example is not balanced because brackets are crossed
- Third example is not balanced because closing bracket comes before opening bracket

Note:
- Empty sequence is considered balanced
- A single bracket or unclosed bracket sequence is not balanced
